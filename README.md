# Software-Maintenance
## Sprite Editor
Run by double click sprite_editor.jar under directory ./bin

This editor supports changing background, however, background cannot be saved while only the painted content can be saved.

You can load a png file from a specified directory, but since the loaded picture's background is not transparent, once loaded, the whole canvas will be covered.

## Space Invaders
My works are modifications based on the original software.

The original software is space invaders. Assets used in the game can be found [here](http://gooperblooper22.deviantart.com/art/Space-Invaders-Sprite-Sheet-135338373).

1. import the project into eclipse workspace 
2. click run
